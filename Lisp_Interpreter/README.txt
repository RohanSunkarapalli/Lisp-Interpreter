Execution –

1. Navigate to the folder where the files are present.
2. Open terminal or any editor where c++ is present. Recommended version is c++11.
3. In terminal, run the below command – 
    
    g++ -std=c++11 -o output lisp.cpp

4. Once, this is done then run the below command to try out the testcases –

    ./output

5. Now, manually you can try out any testcase or run - !test to check out the outputs of all       testcases mentioned in lisp.test file. Else we can even write or edit the tests present in that file and checkout the expected outputs.
